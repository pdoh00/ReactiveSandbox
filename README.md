ReactiveSandbox
===============

Just some random reactiveUI, Reactive Extension stuff

I "think" that I am going to try to create an application that has one viewmodel for each ReactiveUI concept.  
I actually don't know enough about ReactiveUI to know if this is stupid, but hopefully this will help me figure that out.
